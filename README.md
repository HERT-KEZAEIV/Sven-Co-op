# Sven-Co-op
An assortment of test maps, additional information for SC stuff and new entities as well.

Note these information that you will see is my own and Spark's documentation that we did by working on things or helping people to do them.
if you're newbie i'll recomend you to see [Svenmanor](https://sites.google.com/site/svenmanor/) first before.
we're not going to add documentation that already exist there unless a better description is needed.
