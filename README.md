# End of lists

### ambient_generic

<details><summary>Description</summary>
<p>

General information in [svenmanor](https://sites.google.com/site/svenmanor/entguide/ambient_generic)

- Using the spawnflag 64 ( User Only ) and the spawnflag 1 ( Play everywhere ) will make the flag 64 useless and the sound will be played for everyone and the activator will hear it twice.

</p>
</details>

---

### ambient_music

<details><summary>Description</summary>
<p>

General information in [svenmanor](https://sites.google.com/site/svenmanor/entguide/ambient_music)

- For each client. the volume of this entity depends on their configuration for MP3 Volume (Cvar ``MP3Volume`` and ``MP3FadeTime`` ) some players has this always muted. so setting ambient_generic instead would be fine but keep in mind that hearing a song always for each map-restart is annoying at some point.

### config_classic_mode

<details><summary>Description</summary>
<p>

config_classic_mode is a entity that allow you to customize classic mode for monsters, models and items that the game doesn't support.

it also allows you to swap **any** model into a classic model if specified by the entity.

<details><summary>Installation</summary>
<p>

```bat
set Main=https://github.com/Mikk155/Sven-Co-op/raw/main/
set Files=utils config_classic_mode
set output=scripts/maps/mikk/
if not exist %output% (
  mkdir %output:/=\%
)
(for %%a in (%Files%) do (
  curl -LJO %Main%%%a.as
  
  move %%a.as %Output%
)) 
```

In your main map_script add:
```angelscript
#include "mikk/config_classic_mode"

void MapInit()
{
	config_classic_mode::Register();
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Usage</summary>
<p>

Trigger the entity by using USE_TYPE.

- USE_OFF Will disable classic mode.

- USE_ON Will enable Classic mode.

- USE_TOGGLE Will toggle Classic mode.

| key | value | description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| spawnflags | 1 (Restart now) | if set. the current map will be restarted to apply the changes | 
| delay | float | delay before trigger any of its targets |
| target_toggle | target | trigger this target when the classic mode has been successfuly toggled [Supports USE_TYPE](#utils-use-type) |
| target_failed | target | trigger this target when the entity receive USE_ON but the classic mode is actually enabled or when the entity receive USE_OFF but the classic mode is actually disabled [Supports USE_TYPE](#utils-use-type) |
| target_enabled | target | trigger this target if the classic mode has been started enabled. it fires once the map starts [Supports USE_TYPE](#utils-use-type) |
| target_disabled | target | trigger this target if the classic mode has been started disabled. it fires once the map starts [Supports USE_TYPE](#utils-use-type) |
| health | float | this is the entity's think function. using higher value will consume less cpu but players may notice the HD model changing to a classic mode. default is 0.1f + health |

In HAMMER/JACK/BSPGUY open Smart-Edit and add there the keyvalues.

- The key is equal to the classname of the weapon you want to replace when classic mode is enabled.

- The value is equal to the classname of the new weapon that will be set if classic mode is enabled.

**SAMPLE:**
```angelscript
"weapon_m16" "weapon_9mmAR"
```

The same way you can replace any entity's custom model. the syntax is the same.

- The key is equal to the model you want to replace when classic mode is enabled.

- The value is equal to the model that will replace the previus.

**SAMPLE:**
```angelscript
"models/hlclassic/scientist.mdl" "models/headcrab.mdl"
```

### Additional information:

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget that since classic mode is enabled the model you need to replace is not "models/barney.mdl" it is "models/hlclassic/barney.mdl"

- Using (on any entity) custom keyvalue ``"$i_classic_mode_ignore"`` will prevent their model being changed or item being replaced.

‚ö†Ô∏è Use only **one** entity per map. if there is more than one, one random entity will be removed.

| 8 | Print Console | Prints at the console ( set flag 2 or double message will be shown ) |
| 9 | Print Center | Prints at the center of the screen |
| 10 | Print scoreboard | Shows the text as the server's hostname but only apply to the score board popup |


### game_text_custom motd

To set a title you must write it like this
```angelscript
"This is the title# this is the text"
```
The ``"#"`` defines when the title ends and when the message starts

‚ö† JACK/Bspguy has a limit on how many chars you can set so you have to learn ripent if you will use long-size motd.

### game_text_custom spawnflags
| flag | bit | description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| All Players | 1 | shows the message to all connected players. else just activator |
| No console echo | 2 | if set. no console message will be sent |
| Fire per player | 4 | If set. The target will be fired for every player that sees the message. Otherwise the target is fired once every time the entity is fired. |

### game_text_custom replace

We've added a function for replacing a string command into another string.

In this case you want the game_text_custom show a countdown with a message.

``key_integer`` will do the trick.
```angelscript
"message" "The bomb will explode in !integer seconds"
"key_integer" "5"
```
you can in any time update key_integer with trigger_copy/change/value and fire the game_text_custom after affect.
```angelscript
The bomb will explode in 5 seconds
```
``key_float`` is the same but it is a float. ``!float``

``key_string`` is the same but it is a string. ``!string``

``!activator`` will contain the nickname or classname of the player or monster that activated this entity.
```angelscript
"message" "The player !activator is trapped in sector C"
```

i've made this next keys by using it for my own purposes but probably they're useful to you as well.

``focus_entity`` is a target type key. you must target a entity's classname in this. if is empty we'll use the activator.

``key_from_entity`` must be a custom keyvalue that we want to find it in the target entity and get its value.

then its value will replace the command ``!value``

### Un embed textures from a BSP

<details><summary>Description</summary>
<p>

A tool that eliminates imported textures in the maps (``-wadinclude``) and this reduce considerably BSP's file.

You'll need these tools [BSPTexR](https://github.com/Litude/BSPTexRM) and [wally](https://gamebanana.com/tools/4774) and Ripent wich is in Sven Co-op's SDK

You can extract the textures with ripent, Create a wad with wally and finally eliminate the textures imported with BSPTexR

- 1 Extract the textures of your map with ripent
```
ripent -textureexport mapname
```

- 2 Create a folder called ``Vanilla textures``

- 3 Export the textures by default (halflife, opfor, etc etc) a png, tga, jpg or any other format in the folder ``Vanilla textures``

- 4 Create a folder called ``New textures``

- 5 Export the textures of your map in the folder ``New textures``

- 6 Copy all textures from the ``Vanilla textures`` folder and paste inside the ``New textures`` folder and hit "Replace all"

- 7 Now you must press CONTROL+Z the textures in the ``Vanilla textures`` folder should be back that folder leaving ``New textures`` with only the exclusive textures of the map.

- 8 Create a new wad with wally and use all the new textures.

- 9 Use the tool BSPTexR to eliminate all textures of the map
```
bsptexrm mapname
```

- 10 Go to the properties of your map and include the new .wad in the "wad" properties of "worldspawn"

‚ö†Ô∏è Since the BSP has been modified it will differ from older versions but it will also lower considerably it's size.

line 18 should be your server's hostname:
```angelscript
// Name of your server
const string strHostname = "[US] Limitless Potential (Hardcore + Anti-Rush)";
```

Here you must add the new arguments, the first string in the array is the first chars of the map name while the second argument is the display name
```angelscript
// < name of your map        |        title of your hostname >

string[][] strMaps = 
{
    {"hl", "Half-Life"},

    {"rp", "Residual Point"},

    {"rl_", "Residual Life"},

    {"ast_", "A Soldier's Tale"},

    {"tln_", "The Long Night"},

    {"accesspoint", "Access Point"},

    {"bridge_the_gap", "Bridge The Gap"},

    {"bm_sts", "BM: Special Tactics"},

    {"ba", "Blue-Shift"},

    {"hcl", "Hardcore-Life"},

    {"of_utbm", "Under The Black Moon"},

    {"of", "Opposing-Force"}
};
```
Your server's hostname will look like this:
```angelscript
"[US] Limitless Potential (Hardcore + Anti-Rush) Playing Opposing-Force"
```
