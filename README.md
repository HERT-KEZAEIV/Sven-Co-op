# numerical padlock

Creates a full customizable code **on-the-fly** for a numerical padlock. this system works using a game_counter and a trigger_random for randomizing the code needed, feel free to make a better randomizing system of 3 digits from number 0 to 9

once you fire the "randomizing button" 3 copyvalue will paste those random numbers into a trigger_condition.

then every numerical plate will add a value of their owns into another entity while the mentioned trigger_condition will check if the numbers was touched in order and if they're correct.

- If someone is using the camera then others players can't interfer

- using the plate bellow "8" will delete all your previus attempts, basically restore.

- next to player spawn there are some entities that they're only for DEBUG purpose. delete them.
